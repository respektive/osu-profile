fork of [osu-profile](https://github.com/Entrivax/osu-profile) by [Entrivax](https://github.com/Entrivax) with some more stats and features mainly added by me ([respektive on osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1023489/osu)) and [-Koyuki-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8202576)(https://github.com/FreddyBadAdd).

> Note that this is not actively being worked on anymore as it's just a pain in the ass to work with this code. In the future i might start working on a new osu! statistics tracking tool, but till then this has to do. Feel free to fork this yourself to add more stuff, as i probably won't check any PRs either. You might also check out [OsuAchievedOverlay](https://github.com/EngineerMark/OsuAchievedOverlay) which is getting regular updates and might become the spiritual successor of osu!Profile.
